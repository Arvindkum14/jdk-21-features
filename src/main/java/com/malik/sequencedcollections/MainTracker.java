/*
Java 21 introduced the new SequencedCollection interface â€” a major usability enhancement!

ðŸ”¥ In Java 21, List, Deque, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, etc. now implement SequencedCollection, which guarantees a defined iteration order and provides new methods to access elements from both ends of the collection.

âœ… Real-World Example: Recent Activity Tracker (like Browser History)
ðŸ”¹ Use Case:
Imagine building a "recent activity tracker", similar to a browser history or recent documents list. You want:

Insertions at the end (most recent activity)
Easy access to the first and last activities
Reverse iteration (e.g., display newest to oldest)
With SequencedCollection, this becomes clean and elegant.
